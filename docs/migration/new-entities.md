# New entities to add to the Database

These EntityIDs are referenced by `instances.csv` but didn't exist in the seed
data. They came from calendar events that have no matching seed place.

**Status:** the reusable places below are now **seeded** into `data/*.json`
(events, shows, museums→MoMA, hikes→Cascade Falls, restaurants→3 en-route,
spas→Crossfit/Wellness, and a new `accommodation.json` wired into the seed
pipeline). The **logistics** items (arrival, 4 drives, Pre-FIST nap) are
deliberately **not** seeded — they live as trip-local slots, not reusable
Database entities. Real addresses/hours for the new places come next via the
Places-CSV → Gemini enrichment loop.

## Notes & decisions to confirm

- **`attraction-hersheypark` appears 4×** (Thu Jun 25: AM coasters, PM thrills,
  water park) — a clean demonstration of *one entity, many instances*.
- **Drives are their own slots** ("Drive from X → Y"), split out from the bundled
  calendar events. The Mon Jun 22 drive day is now: Brooklyn→New Windsor,
  New Windsor→Hudson (with Kaaterskill as a separate optional stop), Hudson→North
  Adams. Hershey→NYC on Thu Jun 25.
- **Lunch/breakfast that the calendar buried in descriptions** (e.g. the Met's
  "lunch: Central Park / Cocina Consuelo") is kept in the note rather than given
  its own slot, to stay faithful to "the calendar is right." Say the word if you
  want those promoted to real food slots.
- **MoMA** and the **basic Bushwick pizza** fallback: MoMA became a real Plan B
  entity; the un-named pizza slice stayed in a note (no entity).
- The docx's richer per-meal "Food options" lists were **not** all imported —
  only the alternatives the *calendar* preserved. We can pull more from the docx
  if you want fuller Plan B menus.
